# Krishan Chadha . Jarvis Consulting

Technical consultant at Jarvis and Cybersecurity Diploma Graduate from the University of Toronto specialized in certain aspects such as bash scripting, cloud security (AWS/GCP) and Windows/Linux system administration. My interests for software and hardware became apparent to me when jailbreaking my first Iphone and having great respect for the individual who released this hack for anyone to use. This also brought about the question of security and exploits, thus my journey started in mastering cybersecurity/ethical hacking. Working as a technical consultant now and compliance analyst coordinating with data scientists in the past, has given me a good foundation to see both the big and small picture when thinking about cybersecurity from a compliance standpoint. The opportunity to apply and master my skills excites me, and i hope to do so at your company!

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KrishChadha](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KrishChadha)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KrishChadha/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KrishChadha/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Design and implement a linux cluster monitoring solution, capturing hardware specs and real-time resource usage data. Store this data in a PostgreSQL database for generating resource planning reports. Use Bash scripts and automate data collection via cron jobs. Ensure the solution is deployable in a cluster environment, with source code managed on GitHub and the database provisioned using Docker.


## Highlighted Projects
**Anti-Theft Laptop Script** [[GitHub](https://github.com/cKtheGrey/Anti-Theft-Laptop-Script)]: SDeploy a security script that activates upon login (guest honeypot user) to catch potential thieves. The script captures a photo from the webcam, connects to the strongest Wi-Fi signal, retrieves the current geolocation, and sends this data to an email or SSH server instantly. It also starts a keylogger to periodically send further information, helping to build a profile on the individual. Additionally, it includes a custom bootloader image that might be noticed by a computer repair shop if the thief attempts to reformat and sell the laptop.
