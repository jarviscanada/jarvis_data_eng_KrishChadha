summary: As a Technical Consultant at Jarvis, I am continually building on the specialized skills I acquired during my Cybersecurity Diploma from the University of Toronto, including bash scripting, cloud security (AWS/GCP), and Linux/Windows system administration. My fascination with software and hardware started when I innocently jailbroke my first iPhone, admiring the skill of the individual who made it possible. This sparked my interest in security and exploits, leading me to pursue expertise in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. My current role, along with my past experience as a compliance analyst coordinating with data scientists, has equipped me with a well-rounded view of cybersecurity from a compliance perspective.

    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Designed and implemented a linux cluster monitoring solution, capturing hardware specs and real-time resource usage data. Stored this data in a PostgreSQL database for generating resource planning reports. Used Bash scripts and automated data collection via cron jobs. Ensured the solution is deployable in a cluster environment, with source code managed on GitHub and the database provisioned using Docker.

    git_url: "https://github.com/cKtheGrey/Anti-Theft-Laptop-Script"
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Deploys a security script that activates upon login (guest honeypot user) to catch potential thieves. The script captures a photo from the webcam, connects to the strongest Wi-Fi signal, retrieves the current geolocation, and sends this data to an email or SSH server instantly. It also starts a keylogger to periodically send further information, helping to build a profile on the individual. Additionally, it includes a custom bootloader image that might be noticed by a computer repair shop if the thief attempts to reformat and sell the laptop.
