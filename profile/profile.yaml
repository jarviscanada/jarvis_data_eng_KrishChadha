summary: My interests for software and hardware became apparent to me very early when i realized how curated an experience i could create for myself with the right knowhow. It started with jailbreaking my first Iphone and having great respect for the individual who released this hack for anyone to use. It was inspiring to see someone so smart be able to undermine such a large company's interests who they found to be immoral. This also brought about the question of security and exploits, thus my journey started in mastering cybersecurity/ethical hacking. Leading to where i am now, learning more in depth about the foundation of everything that needs securing! Its through this root level approach and understanding that I hope to one day have enough insight to become a Cybersecurity Compliance expert.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Design and implement a monitoring solution for a 10-node Rocky9 Linux cluster, capturing hardware specs and real-time resource usage (CPU, memory) data. Store this data in a PostgreSQL database for generating resource planning reports. Use Bash scripts (host_info.sh for hardware info and host_usage.sh for resource usage) and automate data collection via cron jobs. Ensure the solution is deployable in a cluster environment, with source code managed on GitHub and the database provisioned using Docker.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: SDeploy a security script that activates upon login (guest honeypot user) to catch potential thieves. The script captures a photo from the webcam, connects to the strongest Wi-Fi signal, retrieves the current geolocation, and sends this data to an email or SSH server instantly. It also starts a keylogger to periodically send further information, helping to build a profile on the individual. Additionally, it includes a custom bootloader image that might be noticed by a computer repair shop if the thief attempts to reformat and sell the laptop.
