summary: Technical consultant at Jarvis and Cybersecurity Diploma Graduate from the University of Toronto specialized in certain aspects such as bash scripting, cloud security (AWS/GCP) and Windows/Linux system administration. My interests for software and hardware became apparent to me when jailbreaking my first Iphone and having great respect for the individual who released this hack for anyone to use. This also brought about the question of security and exploits, thus my journey started in mastering cybersecurity/ethical hacking. Working as a technical consultant now and compliance analyst coordinating with data scientists in the past, has given me a good foundation to see both the big and small picture when thinking about cybersecurity from a compliance standpoint. The opportunity to apply and master my skills excites me, and i hope to do so at your company!
